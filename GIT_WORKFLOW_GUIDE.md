## LazyGit Tips

- `c` - Commit
- `P` - Push
- `p` - Pull
- `?` - Show help
- `x` - View menu options
- `/` - Search
- `q` - Quit

## Diffview Tips

### Diff View Keybindings
- `<Tab>` / `<S-Tab>` - Navigate files
- `-` - Stage/unstage file
- `S` - Stage all
- `U` - Unstage all
- `R` - Refresh
- `i` - Toggle list/tree view
- `f` - Flatten directories

- `g<C-x>` - Cycle layout (horizontal/vertical)

### File History Keybindings
- `<CR>` - Open commit
- `y` - Copy commit hash
- `L` - Open commit log
- `j/k` - Navigate
- `zR/zM` - Expand/collapse all folds

## Troubleshooting

### Inline Blame Not Showing
1. Ensure you're in a Git repository
2. Wait 1 second (default delay)
3. Check if blame is enabled: `:Gitsigns toggle_current_line_blame`

### Gitsigns Not Loading
- Open any Git-tracked file (loaded on `BufReadPost`)
- Check `:Lazy` to see if plugin loaded

### LazyGit Not Opening
1. Ensure LazyGit is installed: `brew install lazygit`
2. Check if it's in PATH: `which lazygit`

### Icons Not Showing
- Install a Nerd Font (e.g., `brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts && brew install --cask font-jetbrains-mono-nerd-font`)
- Set terminal to use the Nerd Font
